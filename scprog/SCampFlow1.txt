             -------How to RUN-----
1  expenses20.ods    This is the master 'paper trail'
   Update this with all the new expenses
   phone, electric not on Premier(First Fed)
2  travel is in  HouseLLC/tax20 folder 
   expenses should not be in HouseLLC, but 
   in the latest python folder  
3  add Premier downloads cashflow,guesth, main, farm,
   construction to the st1 folder
4  delete out1/2 folders
5  run topAcct1.py, then check out1:
 
   BankAcct_sorted.txt       <-- scan for any issues, just a sorted
                                 list of the monthly bank statments 
   expensesAnnotated         <-- check for any w/o "--", not in bank statements
                                 'paper trail' annotated
   Reconciled sorted         <-- Any with '-->' needs to be added to paper trail
                                 which is expenses20.ods, and rerun program

-----------------------------------------

1 topAcc1.py
--> conv1: convert LibreOffice to expenses20.csv
--> input: csv files from Premier bank
             cashFlow
	         guestHouse
	         mainHouse
	         Farm
	         Construction
--> output:	 BankAcct.txt  
   call cashFlow1.topcash   cashFlow
   call topproc             guestHouse  
   call topproc             mainHouse 
   call topproc             Construction 
   call topproc             Farm
-----------end of part 1, start part2-------------

Fairly complicated recon2.recon1   

recon2.recon1 
--> input BankAcct_sorted.txt
--> input  expenses.txt 
--> output Reconciled.txt 
   (all BankAccts line entries need to be found
    in expenses.txt )

step1: create numbered list 1a,2a, etc from 'expenses.txt'
       This is cleaned.
	   And list is created (just number, and letter a)
	   
step2: 1 read each line of BankAcct.txt 
       2 get date, and amt from each line
         Using this as 'keys', call findit	
         which rereads expenses.txt, and looks for
         the amt, and date
         If both are found, the stk key is changed to 'b'
         (Number of found record is 'key' into skt[] list)
		 If found, write Reconciled.txt with either
		      ..   or --> (bad!)
	   
step3: call prnstk
       input:  stk list
       input:  expenses.txt
       output: expensesAnnotated.txt
	   if a, only in print, b found on computer file
	   Update prnstk to keep comments in:
            expenses20.ods ---> expenses20.csv          conv1
			expenses20.csv ---> expenses20.txt          recon1
	        expenses20.txt ---> expenseAnnotated.txt    prnstk
-------part 3 -------------------
sortit1.sortit1	  sorts the Reconciled list (computer list)
