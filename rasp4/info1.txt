bashrc calls r1.py

r1.py performs a nmap scan by calling t1.sh

t1.sh dumps scan results into out1.txt

Then r1.py, after a slight delay for file io to
complete, reads in out1.txt, converts to lines
and looks for IPCAM

parse the IPCAM line, for its ip addr

Constructs a cmd to issue to ip3.sh with input parm
which is the IP address of IP cam.
